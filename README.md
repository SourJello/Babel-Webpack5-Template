# React-Webpack5-Template
A frontend template for a Spa using React, webpack5, and whatever else I get to.

The webpack configuration is mostly taken from [this boilerplate repo](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate)
Here is a link to [the authors site](https://www.taniarascia.com/blog). You should check it out.
